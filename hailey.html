					<p>I'm so glad I took this photo! When I met you, you were so perfect, and still are. I remember feeling so comfortable with you right away and like we could talk to eachother so freely. Talking on that dumpster thingy made me feel so connected to you and I was like :O when u layed on my lap. I hope we can go back to that spot again because I feel like it means a lot to me."</p>

Even if it was with Sid and Micheal too, lol. Also happy birthday from last year lol!! this was exactly one year ago from when you are reading this. Tyler was so freaking awesome, chromokooooopiaaaa. I know we were a little sad for a bit on your birthday, but the best thing is that we always work it out and care about eachother feelings so we can go back to being nice and happy in eachothers presence again. It taught me we always move past times of being sad and that we will always find a way to show love to eachother! </p>

					<p>Thats it for now! I know the last month has been kind of uneventful lol, we just b playing videogames, but I guess long distance can be like that. Creating this website has made me reflect on our time together and has honestly made me feel so emotional thinking about you and every moment we've spent together! I know theres more too, that I didn't even get to put, like when we did shrooms and cried in eachothers arms, or also at the pool. When we go on more awesome dates, I will try to update this website too!</p>
